# My portfolio website :)

My personal static portfolio.

## What is this?

So we had a task at school to build a static portfolio website, and here's mine.

This website uses the MIT license.

## What's the concept?

I wanted it to, first of all, showcase my skills in HTML and CSS so far, and second of all to have people learn new things when they look at my site.

## What did you make it with?

I made it with:

- HTML (Pug),
- CSS, and
- PHP (kind of). I made a PHP file to practice form validation, but it does nothing at the moment..

At first, I wanted to use SASS, but I figured that that's too complex to set up and bulky for a static site like this. I also initially wrote this website in pure HTML, but after seeing the final giant of a monolith file, I decided to use Pug so I can modularize code.

For the icons, I used [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com). I downloaded the necessary icon files and put them in `src/assets`. I initially used the cdn, but I think that's too slow, so I switched to hosting the icons myself.

Hopefully you learnt something new from my site. Cheers :)

## Development

For development purposes, first you need to fork this repo, then clone the fork to your local machine. Then, run `npm run dev` to watch Pug.
