# My portfolio :)

My personal static portfolio.

## What is this?

So we had a task at school to build a static portfolio website, and here's mine.

## What's the concept?

I wanted it to, first of all, showcase my skills in HTML and CSS so far, and second of all to have people learn new things when they look at my site.

## What did you make it with?

I made it with:

- HTML,
- CSS, and
- PHP (kind of). I made a PHP file to practice form validation, but it does nothing at the moment..

At first, I wanted to use SASS, but I figured that that's too complex to set up and bulky for a static site like this. For the icons, I used [fontawesome](ttps://fontawesome.com) by making a kit and copy-and-pasting the `<script>` tag into the very bottom of my `<body>` element.

Hopefully you learnt something new from my site. Cheers :)
