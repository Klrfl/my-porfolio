# My portfolio :)
## Overview or something
### What is this?
So we had a task at school to build a static portfolio website, and here's mine.

### What's the concept?
I wanted it to first of all showcase my skills in HTML and CSS so far, and second of all to wow people looking at my site.

### What did you make it with?
I made it with three lagnuages:
- HTML,
- CSS, and
-  PHP.
At first, I wanted to use SASS, but I figured that that's too complex to set up and bulky for a static site like this. For the icons, I used [fontawesome](ttps://fontawesome.com) by making a kit and copy-and-pasting the `<script>` tag into the very bottom of my `<body>` element. I also made a PHP file to practice form validation. It does nothing at the moment..

Hopefully you learnt something new from my site. Cheers :)
